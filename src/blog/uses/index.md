In this article I want to tell you what software and hardware I use to be productive and have a efficient workflow. As I find it helpful to see what others use I'd like to share my stack as well. I'll keep this as a living document as things change regularly.

## Hardware I use

### Smartphone

All I want was a modern and cheap phone which has a headphone jack, LTE band 800 and a fingerprint sensor. The [Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07FP3T6Z4) was the only one I found which met all criteria. I'm super happy with it.

### Computers & desk setup

- On my Desktop I use a iMac Retina 5k 27", late 2015 @ 4x 4.0 GHz, 24GB RAM, 512GB, AMD Radeon R9 M395X w/4GB
- At home and when I'm on the road I use a Macbook Pro 13", 2017 @ 4x 2.3GHz, 8GB RAM (which is insufficient)
- On my desk there are also 2 more monitors: LG 29UM57-P 29" ultra-wide, LG Flatron IPS235P 23"
- My absolute favorite mouse is a Logitech G502 ([with cable](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07GS6ZS8J/), [without](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07QNYCLBJ/)). It's super helpful because of its many buttons which you can program to do certain tasks e.g. switching desktops or controlling music.
- My keyboard is a Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad

### Other stuff

- In-Ear Headphones: [RHA T20i](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B074QJ74BW/). Best in-ears I ever had. I also had the preceding model.
- Over-Ear Headphones: [Audio Technica ATH-M50x](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00HVLUR86/). Great headphones but I use my in-ears most of the time.
- Xiaomi Band 4 fitness-tracker: Nice gadget to keep on track with my activities. It helps me keep in motion and is a little motivation to do more sport. It also helps to analyze my sleep and is a lightweight watch.
- [Amazon Echo Dot](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07PHPXHQS/): Handy gadget which helps me with different things like controlling my music, putting things on my grocery list, adding todos to my todo list, wake me up and controlling my lights (this are the features I mostly use).

## Software and tools I use

This list could be really long, because there is a huge amount of tools I use. I'll try to focus on the ones I find most helpful regarding my personal workflow and skip the ones business related.
